# Weaver Game

## Overview

Welcome to the **Weaver Game**! In this game, you try to find a way to transform a starting word into an ending word by changing one letter at a time. Each intermediate word must be a valid word from the dictionary. This was my first project in C for the course CS 211 (UIC).

## Features

- **Word Transformation**: Change one letter at a time to reach the target word.
- **Random Word Option**: Start or end with a random word from the dictionary.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive prompts to guide you through the game.
- **Dynamic Word Length**: Choose the number of letters in your words.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A terminal or command line interface
- A text file named `words.txt` containing valid dictionary words

### Enjoy the game!
